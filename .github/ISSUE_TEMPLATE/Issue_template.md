You can find assistance at our community forums: https://developer.mongodb.com/community/forums/tags/c/drivers-odms/7/node-js
We use JIRA to track issues and feature requests: https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/NODE

Our GitHub Issues are left open for now as we work to deprecate this method of issue reporting.
Thank you for understanding.
