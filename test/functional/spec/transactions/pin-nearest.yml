# Test that all the operations go to the same server.
#
# The assertion is implicit: that all the read operations succeed,
# as if the driver does not properly pin to a server then one of them
# will eventually be sent to a different server, which is unaware of the
# transaction, and it will report an error
#
# This test doesn't check contents of command-started events.
