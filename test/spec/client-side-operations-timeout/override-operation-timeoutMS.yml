tests:
  # For each level operation, we execute two tests:
  #
  # 1. timeoutMS can be overridden to a non-zero value for an operation. Each test executes an operation using one of
  # the entities defined above with an overridden timeoutMS=1000 and configures a fail point to block the operation for
  # 15ms so the operation succeeds.
  #
  # 2. timeoutMS can be overridden to 0 for an operation. Each test executes an operation using the entities defined
  # above with an overridden timeoutMS=0 so the operation succeeds.
