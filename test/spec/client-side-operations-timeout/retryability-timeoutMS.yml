tests:
  # For each retryable operation, run three tests:
  #
  # 1. timeoutMS applies to the whole operation, not to individual attempts - Client timeoutMS=100 and the operation is
  # fails with a retryable error after being blocked server-side for 60ms. The operation should fail with a timeout error
  # because the second attempt should take it over the 100ms limit. This test only runs on 4.4+ because it uses the
  # blockConnection option in failCommand.
  #
  # 2. operation is retried multiple times if timeoutMS is set to a non-zero value - Client timeoutMS=100 and the
  # operation fails with a retryable error twice. Drivers should send the original operation and two retries, the
  # second of which should succeed.
  #
  # 3. operation is retried multiple times if timeoutMS is set to a zero - Override timeoutMS to zero for the operation
  # and set a fail point to force a retryable error twice. Drivers should send the original operation and two retries,
  # the second of which should succeed.
  #
  # The fail points in these tests use error code 7 (HostNotFound) because it is a retryable error but does not trigger
  # an SDAM state change so we don't lose any time to server rediscovery. The tests also explicitly specify an
  # errorLabels array in the fail point to avoid behavioral differences among server types and ensure that the error
  # will be considered retryable.
