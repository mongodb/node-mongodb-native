Introduction
============

The YAML and JSON files in this directory tree are platform-independent tests
that drivers can use to prove their conformance to the CRUD spec.

Running these integration tests will require a running MongoDB server or
cluster with server versions 2.6.0 or later. Some tests have specific server
version requirements as noted by the ``runOn`` section, if provided.

Subdirectories for Test Formats
-------------------------------

This document describes a legacy format for CRUD tests: legacy-v1, which dates back
to the first version of the CRUD specification. New CRUD tests should be written
in the `unified test format <../../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.rst>`_
and placed under ``unified/``. Until such time that all original tests have been ported
to the unified test format, tests in each format will be grouped in their own subdirectory:

- ``v1/``: Legacy-v1 format tests
- ``unified/``: Tests using the `unified test format <../../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.rst>`_

Since some drivers may not have a unified test runner capable of executing tests
in all two formats, segregating tests in this manner will make it easier for
drivers to sync and feed test files to different test runners.

Legacy-v1 Test Format for Single Operations
-------------------------------------------

*Note: this section pertains to test files in the "v1" directory.*

The test format above supports both multiple operations and APM expectations,
and is consistent with the formats used by other specifications. Previously, the
CRUD spec tests used a simplified format that only allowed for executing a
single operation. Notable differences from the legacy-v2 format are as follows:

- Instead of a ``tests[i].operations`` array, a single operation was defined as
  a document in ``tests[i].operation``. That document consisted of only the
  ``name``, ``arguments``, and an optional ``object`` field.

- Instead of ``error`` and ``result`` fields within each element in the
  ``tests[i].operations`` array, the single operation's error and result were
  defined under the ``tests[i].outcome.error`` and ``tests[i].outcome.result``
  fields.

- Instead of a top-level ``runOn`` field, server requirements are denoted by
  separate top-level ``minServerVersion``, ``maxServerVersion``, and
  ``serverless`` fields. The minimum server version is an inclusive lower bound
  for running the test. The maximum server version is an exclusive upper bound
  for running the test. If a field is not present, it should be assumed that
  there is no corresponding bound on the required server version. The
  ``serverless`` requirement behaves the same as the ``serverless`` field of the
  `unified test format's runOnRequirement <../../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.rst#runonrequirement>`_.

The legacy-v1 format should not conflict with the newer, multi-operation format
used by other specs (e.g. Transactions). It is possible to create a unified test
runner capable of executing both legacy formats (as some drivers do).

Error Assertions for Bulk Write Operations
==========================================

When asserting errors (e.g. ``errorContains``, ``errorCodeName``) for bulk write
operations, the test harness should inspect the ``writeConcernError`` and/or
``writeErrors`` properties of the bulk write exception. This may not be needed for
``errorContains`` if a driver concatenates all write and write concern error
messages into the bulk write exception's top-level message.

Test Runner Implementation
==========================

This section provides guidance for implementing a test runner for legacy-v1
tests. See the `unified test format spec <../../../../unified-test-format/unified-test-format.rst>`_ for how to run tests under
``unified/``.

Before running the tests:

- Create a global MongoClient (``globalMongoClient``) and connect to the server.
  This client will be used for executing meta operations, such as checking
  server versions and preparing data fixtures.

For each test file:

- Using ``globalMongoClient``, check that the current server version satisfies
  one of the configurations provided in the top-level ``runOn`` field in the test
  file (if applicable). If the
  requirements are not satisifed, the test file should be skipped.

- Determine the collection and database under test, utilizing the top-level
  ``collection_name`` and/or ``database_name`` fields if present.

- For each element in the ``tests`` array:

  - Using ``globalMongoClient``, ensure that the collection and/or database
    under test is in a "clean" state, as needed. This may be accomplished by
    dropping the database; however, drivers may also decide to drop individual
    collections as needed (this may be more performant).

  - If the top-level ``data`` field is present in the test file, insert the
    corresponding data into the collection under test using
    ``globalMongoClient``.

  - If the the ``failPoint`` field is present, use ``globalMongoClient`` to
    configure the fail point on the primary server. See
    `Server Fail Point <../../transactions/tests#server-fail-point>`_ in the
    Transactions spec test documentation for more information.

  - Create a local MongoClient (``localMongoClient``) and connect to the server.
    This client will be used for executing the test case.

    - If ``clientOptions`` is present, those options should be used to create
      the client. Drivers MAY merge these options atop existing defaults (e.g.
      reduced ``serverSelectionTimeoutMS`` value for faster test failures) at
      their own discretion.

  - Activate command monitoring for ``localMongoClient`` and begin capturing
    events. Note that some events may need to be filtered out if the driver
    uses global listeners or reports internal commands (e.g. ``hello``, legacy
    hello, authentication).

  - For each element in the ``operations`` array:

    - Using ``localMongoClient``, select the appropriate ``object`` to execute
      the operation. Default to the collection under test if this field is not
      present.

      - If ``collectionOptions`` is present, those options should be used to
        construct the collection object.

    - Given the ``name`` and ``arguments``, execute the operation on the object
      under test. Capture the result of the operation, if any, and observe
      whether an error occurred. If an error is encountered that includes a
      result (e.g. BulkWriteException), extract the result object.

    - If ``error`` is present and true, assert that the operation encountered an
      error. Otherwise, assert that no error was encountered.

    - if ``result`` is present, assert that it matches the operation's result.

  - Deactivate command monitoring for ``localMongoClient``.

  - If the ``expectations`` array is present, assert that the sequence of
    emitted CommandStartedEvents from executing the operation(s) matches the
    sequence of ``command_started_event`` objects in the ``expectations`` array.

  - If the ``outcome`` field is present, assert the contents of the specified
    collection using ``globalMongoClient``.
    Note the server does not guarantee that documents returned by a find
    command will be in inserted order. This find MUST sort by ``{_id:1}``.

Evaluating Matches
------------------

The expected values for results (e.g. ``result`` for an operation
operation, ``command_started_event.command``, elements in ``outcome.data``) are
written in `Extended JSON <../../extended-json.rst>`_. Drivers may adopt any of
the following approaches to comparisons, as long as they are consistent:

- Convert ``actual`` to Extended JSON and compare to ``expected``
- Convert ``expected`` and ``actual`` to BSON, and compare them
- Convert ``expected`` and ``actual`` to native representations, and compare
  them

Extra Fields in Actual Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When comparing ``actual`` and ``expected`` *documents*, drivers should permit
``actual`` documents to contain additional fields not present in ``expected``.
For example, the following documents match:

- ``expected`` is ``{ "x": 1 }``
- ``actual`` is ``{ "_id": { "$oid" : "000000000000000000000001" }, "x": 1 }``

In this sense, ``expected`` may be a subset of ``actual``. It may also be
helpful to think of ``expected`` as a form of query criteria. The intention
behind this rule is that it is not always feasible for the test to express all
fields in the expected document(s) (e.g. session and cluster time information
in a ``command_started_event.command`` document).

This rule for allowing extra fields in ``actual`` only applies for values that
correspond to a document. For instance, an actual result of ``[1, 2, 3, 4]`` for
a ``distinct`` operation would not match an expected result of ``[1, 2, 3]``.
Likewise with the ``find`` operation, this rule would only apply when matching
documents *within* the expected result array and actual cursor.

Note that in the case of result objects for some CRUD operations, ``expected``
may condition additional, optional fields (see:
`Optional Fields in Expected Result Objects`_).

Fields that must NOT be present in Actual Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some command-started events in ``expectations`` include ``null`` values for
optional fields such as ``allowDiskUse``.
Tests MUST assert that the actual command **omits** any field that has a
``null`` value in the expected command.

Optional Fields in Expected Result Objects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some ``expected`` results may include fields that are optional in the CRUD
specification, such as ``insertedId`` (for InsertOneResult), ``insertedIds``
(for InsertManyResult), and ``upsertedCount`` (for UpdateResult). Drivers that
do not implement these fields should ignore them when comparing ``actual`` with
``expected``.

Prose Tests
===========

The following tests have not yet been automated, but MUST still be tested.

1. WriteConcernError.details exposes writeConcernError.errInfo
--------------------------------------------------------------

Test that ``writeConcernError.errInfo`` in a command response is propagated as
``WriteConcernError.details`` (or equivalent) in the driver.

Using a 4.0+ server, set the following failpoint:

.. code:: javascript

   {
     "configureFailPoint": "failCommand",
     "data": {
       "failCommands": ["insert"],
       "writeConcernError": {
         "code": 100,
         "codeName": "UnsatisfiableWriteConcern",
         "errmsg": "Not enough data-bearing nodes",
         "errInfo": {
           "writeConcern": {
             "w": 2,
             "wtimeout": 0,
             "provenance": "clientSupplied"
           }
         }
       }
     },
     "mode": { "times": 1 }
   }

Then, perform an insert operation and assert that a WriteConcernError occurs and
that its ``details`` property is both accessible and matches the ``errInfo``
object from the failpoint.

2. WriteError.details exposes writeErrors[].errInfo
---------------------------------------------------

Test that ``writeErrors[].errInfo`` in a command response is propagated as
``WriteError.details`` (or equivalent) in the driver.

Using a 5.0+ server, create a collection with
`document validation <https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/schema-validation/>`_
like so:

.. code:: javascript

   {
     "create": "test",
     "validator": {
       "x": { $type: "string" }
     }
   }

Enable `command monitoring <../../command-monitoring/command-monitoring.rst>`_
to observe CommandSucceededEvents. Then, insert an invalid document (e.g.
``{x: 1}``) and assert that a WriteError occurs, that its code is ``121``
(i.e. DocumentValidationFailure), and that its ``details`` property is
accessible. Additionally, assert that a CommandSucceededEvent was observed and
that the ``writeErrors[0].errInfo`` field in the response document matches the
WriteError's ``details`` property.
