# When srvMaxHosts is less than the number of SRV records, a random subset of
# hosts are added to the seed list. We cannot anticipate which hosts will be
# selected, so this test uses numSeeds instead of seeds. Since this is a replica
# set, all hosts should ultimately be discovered by SDAM.
#
# The replicaSet URI option is omitted to avoid a URI validation error.
