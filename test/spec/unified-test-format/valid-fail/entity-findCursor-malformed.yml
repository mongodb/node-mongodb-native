# This test is split out into a separate file to accommodate drivers that validate operation structure while decoding
# from JSON/YML. Such drivers fail to decode any files containing invalid operations. Combining this test in a file
# with other entity-findCursor valid-fail tests, which test failures that occur during test execution, would prevent
# such drivers from decoding the file and running any of the tests.
