  /**
   * For this test, configure an APM listener on a client and execute a query on the test.driverdata collection
   * that will leave a cursor open on the server (e.g. specify batchSize=2 for a query that would match 3+ documents).
   * Drivers MAY iterate the cursor if necessary to execute the initial find command but MUST NOT iterate further to avoid executing a getMore.
   *
   * Observe the CommandSucceededEvent event for the find command and extract the cursor's ID and namespace from the response document's cursor.id
   * and cursor.ns fields, respectively. Destroy the cursor object and observe a CommandStartedEvent and CommandSucceededEvent for the killCursors command.
   *
   * Assert that the cursor ID and target namespace in the outgoing command match the values from the find command's CommandSucceededEvent.
   * When matching the namespace, note that the killCursors field will contain the collection name and the database may be inferred from either
   * the $db field or accessed via the CommandStartedEvent directly.
   *
   * Finally, assert that the killCursors CommandSucceededEvent indicates that the expected cursor was killed in the cursorsKilled field.
   *
   * Note: this test assumes that drivers only issue a killCursors command internally when destroying a cursor that may still exist on the server.
   * If a driver constructs and issues killCursors commands in other ways (e.g. public API), this test MUST be adapted to test all such code paths.
