      <description>Projections By default, queries in MongoDB return all fields in matching documents. To limit the amount of data that MongoDB sends to applications, you can include a projection document in the query operation.
Projection Document The projection document limits the fields to return for all matching documents. The projection document can specify the inclusion of fields or the exclusion of field and has the following form:
{ field1: &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;, field2: &amp;lt;value&amp;gt; .</description>

      <description>The GridFS API The MongoDB Node.js driver now supports a stream-based API for GridFS that&amp;rsquo;s compatible with Node.js&amp;rsquo; streams3, so you can .pipe() directly from file streams to MongoDB. In this tutorial, you&amp;rsquo;ll see how to use the new GridFS streaming API to upload a CC-licensed 28 MB recording of the overture from Richard Wagner&amp;rsquo;s opera Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg to MongoDB using streams.
Uploading a File You can use GridFS to upload a file to MongoDB.</description>

      <description>GridFS GridFS is a specification for storing and retrieving files that exceed the BSON-document size limit of 16 megabytes.
Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks, and stores each of those chunks as a separate document. By default, GridFS limits chunk size to 255 kilobytes. GridFS uses two collections to store files: the chunks collection which stores the file chunks, and the files collection that stores the file metadata.</description>

      <description>Authentication The Node.js driver supports all MongoDB authentication mechanisms, including those only available in the MongoDB Enterprise Edition.
DEFAULT Note Starting in MongoDB 3.0, MongoDB changed the default authentication mechanism from MONGODB-CR to SCRAM-SHA-1.
 To use the default mechanism, either omit the authentication mechanism specification or specify DEFAULT as the mechanism in the URI ConnectionString. The driver will attempt to authenticate using the SCRAM-SHA-1 authentication method if it is available on the MongoDB server.</description>

      <description>Collections MongoDB stores documents in collections. If a collection does not exist, MongoDB creates the collection when you first store data for that collection.
You can also explicitly create a collection with various options, such as setting the maximum size or the documentation validation rules.
Capped Collection Capped collections have maximum size or document counts that prevent them from growing beyond maximum thresholds. All capped collections must specify a maximum size and may also specify a maximum document count.</description>

      <description>Database Commands Database commands allow you to perform a wide range of diagnostic and administrative tasks with the Node.js driver. For example, the dbStats command returns storage statistics for a given database. Use the command function to access database commands.
// set up a command function function getDbStats(db, callback) { db.command({&#39;dbStats&#39;: 1}, function(err, results) { console.log(results); callback(); }); }; // use the function const MongoClient = require(&#39;mongodb&#39;).MongoClient; const assert = require(&#39;assert&#39;); // Connection URL const url = &#39;mongodb://localhost:27017&#39;; // Database Name const dbName = &#39;myproject&#39;; // Use connect method to connect to the Server MongoClient.</description>

      <description>Geospatial Search You can query against geospatial indexes in several ways via the Node.js driver, using geospatial query operators.
To create a 2dsphere index on a collection, pass a document containing the name of the field to be indexed with the value &amp;lsquo;2dsphere&amp;rsquo; to the createIndex() method.
function create2dSphereIndex(db, callback) { // Get the restaurants collection const collection = db.collection(&#39;restaurants&#39;); // Create the index collection.createIndex( { &#39;address.coord&#39; : &amp;quot;2dsphere&amp;quot; }, function(err, result) { console.</description>

      <description>Note The GridStore API is deprecated. Driver version 2.0 and later uses the GridFS API.
 GridStore GridStore is a single file inside GridFS that can be managed by the script.
Open a GridFS file Opening a GridStore is similar to opening a database. First you create a GridStore object, then open it.
const gs = new GridStore(db, filename, mode[, options])  Where:
 db is the database object filename is the name of the file in GridFS that needs to be accessed/created mode indicates the operation, can be one of:  &amp;ldquo;r&amp;rdquo; (Read): Looks for the file information in fs.</description>

      <description>Migrating Your Application To 2.x There are some key changes in the driver that you should be aware of before migrating your application from version 1.x to 2.x. Some APIs are cleaned up, and some 1.x features have been deprecated.
Design differences in 2.x One major change is that the driver has been split into two pieces. There is a new mongodb-core that contains the low-level MongoDB APIs while mongodb contains the high-level driver.</description>

      <description>CRUD Operations For a walkthrough of the main CRUD operations please refer to the Quick Start guide.
Driver CRUD operations are defined as the operations performed to create, read, update, and delete documents. This tutorial covers both the basic CRUD methods and the specialized findAndModify based methods as well as the new Bulk API methods for efficient bulk write operations.
 Write Methods Write methods are divided into those which insert documents into a collection, those which update documents in a collection, and those which remove documents from a collection.</description>

      <description>Overview Collations provide a set of rules which comply with the conventions of a particular language when comparing strings.
For example, in Canadian French, the last accent in a given word determines the sorting order.
Consider the following French words:
cote &amp;lt; coté &amp;lt; côte &amp;lt; côté  The sort order using the Canadian French collation would result in the following:
cote &amp;lt; côte &amp;lt; coté &amp;lt; côté  If collation is unspecified, MongoDB uses the simple binary comparison for strings.</description>

      <description>Driver Pool Design The 2.0 series of the mongodb-core module introduced a newly re-designed pool that will grow and contract based on the usage pattern. This reference outlines how the growing/shrinking of the pool works, how authentication is handled and how operations are executed.
Operations are executed using a work-queue. That means the Pool is responsible for scheduling the execution of operations on connections. The benefit of this is that one avoids slow operations holding up fast operations as long as the following holds true.</description>
