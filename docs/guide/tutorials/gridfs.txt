GridFS
======

:manual:`GridFS </core/gridfs/>` is a specification for storing and 
retrieving files that exceed the :manual:`BSON-document size limit </reference/limits/#limit-bson-document-size>` 
of 16 megabytes.

Instead of storing a file in a single document, GridFS divides a file into parts, or chunks,
and stores each of those chunks as a separate document. By default, GridFS limits chunk size
to 255 kilobytes. GridFS uses two collections to store files: the ``chunks`` collection which
stores the file chunks, and the ``files`` collection that stores the file metadata.

When you query a GridFS store for a file, the driver or client will reassemble the chunks as 
needed. GridFS is useful not only for storing files that exceed 16 megabytes but also for
storing any files which you want to access without having to load the entire file into memory.

The Node Driver supports GridFS with an api that is compatible with
`Node Streams <https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/stream.html>`_ , so you can ``.pipe()`` 
directly from file streams to MongoDB. In this tutorial, you will see how to use the GridFS
streaming API to upload
`a CC-licensed 28 MB recording of the overture from Richard Wagner's opera *Die Meistersinger von Nurnberg* <https://musopen.org/music/213/richard-wagner/die-meistersinger-von-nurnberg-overture/>`_
to MongoDB using streams.

Uploading a File
----------------

You can use GridFS to upload a file to MongoDB. This example
assumes that you have a file named ``meistersinger.mp3`` in the
root directory of your project. You can use whichever file you want, or you
can just download a `\ *Die Meistersinger* Overture mp3 <https://musopen.org/music/213/richard-wagner/die-meistersinger-von-nurnberg-overture/>`_.

In order to use the streaming GridFS API, you first need to create
a ``GridFSBucket``.

.. code-block:: js

   const { MongoClient, GridFSBucket } = require('mongodb');

   const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
   const dbName = 'test';

   const client = new MongoClient(uri);

   client.connect().then(async function() {
     try {
       const db = client.db(dbName);
       const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db);

       // Use bucket...
     } finally {
       await client.close();
     }
   });

The bucket has an ``openUploadStream()`` method that creates an upload stream for a given
file name. You can pipe a Node.js ``fs`` read stream to the upload stream.

.. code-block:: js

   const fs = require('fs');
   const { MongoClient, GridFSBucket } = require('mongodb');

   const uri = 'mongodb://localhost:27017';
   const dbName = 'test';

   const client = new MongoClient(uri);

   client.connect().then(async function() {
     try {
       const db = client.db(dbName);
       const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db);

       // We need to make sure we wait for finish or error,
       // so we wrap this all in a Promise.

       await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
         fs.createReadStream('./meistersinger.mp3')
           .pipe(bucket.openUploadStream('meistersinger.mp3'))
           .on('error', reject)
           .on('finish', resolve);
       });
       console.log('done!');
     } finally {
       await client.close();
     }
   });

Assuming that your ``test`` database was empty, you should see that the above
script created 2 collections in your ``test`` database: ``fs.chunks`` and
``fs.files``. The ``fs.files`` collection contains high-level metadata about
the files stored in this bucket. For instance, the file you just uploaded
has a document that looks like what you see below.

.. code-block:: js

   > db.fs.files.findOne()
   {
       "_id" : ObjectId("561fc381e81346c82d6397bb"),
       "length" : 27847575,
       "chunkSize" : 261120,
       "uploadDate" : ISODate("2015-10-15T15:17:21.819Z"),
       "md5" : "2459f1cdec4d9af39117c3424326d5e5",
       "filename" : "meistersinger.mp3"
   }

The above document indicates that the file is named 'meistersinger.mp3', and tells
you its size in bytes, when it was uploaded, and the
`md5 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5>`_ of the contents. There's also a
``chunkSize`` field indicating that the file is
broken up into chunks of size 255 kilobytes, which is the
default.

.. code-block:: js

   > db.fs.chunks.count()
   107

Not surprisingly, 27847575/261120 is approximately 106.64, so the ``fs.chunks``
collection contains 106 chunks with size 255KB and 1 chunk that's roughly
255KB * 0.64. Each individual chunks document is similar to the document below.

.. code-block:: js

   > db.fs.chunks.findOne({}, { data: 0 })
   {
       "_id" : ObjectId("561fc381e81346c82d6397bc"),
       "files_id" : ObjectId("561fc381e81346c82d6397bb"),
       "n" : 0
   }

The chunk document keeps track of which file it belongs to and its order in
the list of chunks. The chunk document also has a ``data`` field that contains
the raw bytes of the file.

You can configure both the chunk size and the ``fs`` prefix for the files and
chunks collections at the bucket level. For instance, if you specify the
``chunkSizeBytes`` and ``bucketName`` options as shown below, you'll get
27195 chunks in the ``songs.chunks`` collection.

.. code-block:: js

   const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db, {
     chunkSizeBytes: 1024,
     bucketName: 'songs'
   });


   await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     fs.createReadStream('./meistersinger.mp3')
       .pipe(bucket.openUploadStream('meistersinger.mp3'))
       .on('error', reject)
       .on('finish', resolve);
   });

   console.log('done!');

Downloading a File
------------------

Congratulations, you've successfully uploaded a file to MongoDB! However,
a file sitting in MongoDB isn't particularly useful. In order to stream the
file to your hard drive, an HTTP response, or to npm modules like
`speaker <https://www.npmjs.com/package/speaker>`_\ , you're going to need
a download stream. The easiest way to get a download stream is
the ``openDownloadStreamByName()`` method.

.. code-block:: js

   const bucket = new GridFSBucket(db, {
     chunkSizeBytes: 1024,
     bucketName: 'songs'
   });

   await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     bucket.openDownloadStreamByName('meistersinger.mp3')
       .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./output.mp3'))
       .on('error', reject)
       .on('finish', resolve);
   });
   
   console.log('done!');

Now, you have an ``output.mp3`` file that's a copy of the original
``meistersinger.mp3`` file. The download stream also enables you to do some
neat tricks. For instance, you can cut off the beginning of the song by
specifying a number of bytes to skip. You can cut off the first 41 seconds of
the mp3 and skip right to the good part of the song as shown below.

.. code-block:: js

   await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
     bucket.openDownloadStreamByName('meistersinger.mp3')
       .start(1024 * 1585). // <-- skip the first 1585 KB, approximately 41 seconds
       .pipe(fs.createWriteStream('./output.mp3'))
       .on('error', reject)
       .on('finish', resolve);
   });
   
   console.log('done!');

An important point to be aware of regarding performance is that the GridFS
streaming API can't load partial chunks. When a download stream needs to pull a
chunk from MongoDB, it pulls the entire chunk into memory. The 255 kilobyte default
chunk size is usually sufficient, but you can reduce the chunk size to reduce
memory overhead.
