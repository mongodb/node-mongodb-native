Installation Guide
==================

The recommended way to get started using the Node.js driver is by using ``NPM`` (Node Package Manager) to install the dependency in your project.

MongoDB Driver
--------------

After you've created your project with ``npm init`` , you can install the MongoDB driver and its dependencies with the command:

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install mongodb --save

This will download the MongoDB driver and add a dependency entry in your ``package.json`` file.

Troubleshooting
---------------

The MongoDB driver depends on several other packages, including:

* `bson <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bson>`_
* `denque <https://github.com/invertase/denque>`_
* `bl <https://github.com/rvagg/bl>`_

Additionally, there are multiple optional dependencies that can be installed alongside the driver:

* `bson-ext <https://www.npmjs.com/package/bson-ext>`_
* `kerberos <https://www.npmjs.com/package/kerberos>`_
* `mongodb-client-encryption <https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb-client-encryption>`_
* `snappy <https://www.npmjs.com/package/snappy>`_

These optional modules are all native C++ extensions. They are optional extensions and are not required for the driver to function. Most of these modules use the `prebuild <https://www.npmjs.com/package/prebuild>`_ package to generate pre-built binaries for various operating systems and versions of node. This pre-built version will be downloaded during the ``postinstall`` stage, removing the need to build the native bindings on the system.

bson-ext Module
---------------

The ``bson-ext`` module is an alternative **BSON** parser that is written in C++. If you wish to use the ``bson-ext`` module you will need to add the ``bson-ext`` module to your module's dependencies.

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install bson-ext --save

kerberos Module
---------------

If you need support for connecting to an LDAP environment, you will need to add the ``kerberos`` module to your module's dependencies.

.. code-block:: sh

   npm install kerberos --save

For most versions of node and most operating systems, ``kerberos`` will download a binary generated with ``prebuild``, removing the need to compile the native bindings. If your setup is not included in our pre-built binaries, or if you need to build
kerberos without network access, please see `the kerberos README <https://github.com/mongodb-js/kerberos/blob/master/README.md#requirements>`_ for instructions on how to build the library manually.
