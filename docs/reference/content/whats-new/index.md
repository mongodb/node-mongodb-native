# What's New in 2.0

Key features of the 2.0 driver include:

- Adherence to the SDAM (Server Discovery and Monitoring Specification)
- Implementation of the CRUD Specification
- Performance improvements
- New JS-BSON parser which replaces the C++ extension
- A new core driver on top of which you can build alternative or experimental driver APIs

# What's New in 2.1

Key features of the 2.1 driver include:

- Implements the new GridFS specification
- Implements support for the new 3.2 wire protocol level **find**, **getMore** and **killCursor** commands
- A growing/shrinking connection pool
- A worker-based connection pool which minimizes the impact of slow operations on throughput and latency when the number of slow operations is less than the number of connections in the pool
- Topology monitoring specification implementation, allowing applications to monitor the view of the topology as it changes
