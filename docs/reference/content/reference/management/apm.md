# APM

Application Performance Monitoring support is a driver
feature that allows monitoring services to hook into the
driver in a forward compatible and stable way. The API is
not applied to the driver unless explicitly initialized to
avoid any performance penalties.

## API

The following code example hooks into all the available features
of the APM API.

```js
var listener = require('mongodb').instrument({
  operationIdGenerator: {
    operationId: 1,

    next: function() {
      return this.operationId++;
    }
  },

  timestampGenerator: {
    current: function() {
      return new Date().getTime();
    },

    duration: function(start, end) {
      return end - start;
    }
  }  
}, function(err, instrumentations) {
  // Instrument the driver  
});

listener.on('started', function(event) {
  // command start event (see https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/command-monitoring/command-monitoring.rst)
});

listener.on('succeeded', function(event) {
  // command success event (see https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/command-monitoring/command-monitoring.rst)
});

listener.on('failed', function(event) {
  // command failure event (see https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/command-monitoring/command-monitoring.rst)
});

```

There are two main aspects to the APM API. The first one is the command monitoring specification and the second one is the instrumentation method.

## Command Monitoring

Command monitoring is based on the cross-driver specification for MongoDB found in the Command monitoring [specification](https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/command-monitoring/command-monitoring.rst).

The Command monitoring specification is a low-level monitoring specification that sends a notification when a new command is executed against MongoDB and if it fails or succeeds. In most cases this is straightforward and you will receive a single start and either a success or failure event. 

In this example, the user executes the `isMaster` command against the server and receives the following messages (full objects are abbreviated for simplicity's sake). When the `isMaster` command starts execution we receive the following event (this result is from `JSON.stringify`; in the real event the connectionId is the actual connection object the command was executed against).

```js
{
  "command": {
    "ismaster": true
  },
  "databaseName": "system",
  "commandName": "ismaster",
  "requestId": 7,
  "operationId": 1,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 8,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  }
}
```

`requestId` is the id used for the wire protocol message sent to MongoDB and allows you to correlate the commands executed on MongoDB with the commands from the driver.

`operationId` is an id that is used to group commands into a single logical command execution. Use cases are queries and batch writes where a single logical operation might be executed as multiple commands to the server. For a query this might mean it gets executed as a `find` command and *n* number of `getMore` commands as well as a `killCursors` command. For bulk writes the logical grouping might contain `n` individual write operations. The goal of `operationId` is to allow APM providers to correlate the breakdown of a cursor or bulk operation with the method called by the user. 

A typical example:

```js
db.collection('data').find().batchSize(2).toArray(function(err, docs) {
});
```

That might be translated to `1` find, `n` getMores and `0|1` killCursors.

After the command executed successfully it sends the following result:

```js
{
  "duration": 0,
  "commandName": "ismaster",
  "requestId": 7,
  "operationId": 1,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 8,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  },
  "reply": {
    "ismaster": true,
    "maxBsonObjectSize": 16777216,
    "maxMessageSizeBytes": 48000000,
    "maxWriteBatchSize": 1000,
    "localTime": "2015-08-04T10:26:01.445Z",
    "maxWireVersion": 3,
    "minWireVersion": 0,
    "ok": 1
  }
}
```

Notice that the `requestId` and `operationId` match up to the start message, allowing the user of the API to correlate the two events. 

The next example shows a complete `find` operation that results in multiple `getMore` responses.

```js
{
  "command": {
    "find": "apm_test_2",
    "filter": {
      "a": 1
    },
    "sort": {
      "a": 1
    },
    "projection": {
      "_id": 1,
      "a": 1
    },
    "limit": 100,
    "skip": 1,
    "hint": {
      "_id": 1
    },
    "batchSize": 2,
    "comment": "some comment",
    "maxScan": 1000,
    "maxTimeMS": 5000,
    "noCursorTimeout": true
  },
  "databaseName": "integration_tests",
  "commandName": "find",
  "requestId": 44,
  "operationId": 39,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 19,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  }
}
{
  "duration": 1,
  "commandName": "find",
  "requestId": 44,
  "operationId": 39,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 19,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  },
  "reply": [
    {
      "_id": "55c096386e3b2283b70c294d",
      "a": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": "55c096386e3b2283b70c294e",
      "a": 1
    }
  ]
}
{
  "command": {
    "getMore": "104961726686",
    "collection": "apm_test_2",
    "batchSize": 2,
    "maxTimeMS": 5000
  },
  "databaseName": "integration_tests",
  "commandName": "getMore",
  "requestId": 44,
  "operationId": 39,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 19,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  }
}
{
  "duration": 1,
  "commandName": "getMore",
  "requestId": 44,
  "operationId": 39,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 19,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  },
  "reply": [
    {
      "_id": "55c096386e3b2283b70c294f",
      "a": 1
    },
    {
      "_id": "55c096386e3b2283b70c2950",
      "a": 1
    }
  ]
}
{
  "command": {
    "getMore": "104961726686",
    "collection": "apm_test_2",
    "batchSize": 2,
    "maxTimeMS": 5000
  },
  "databaseName": "integration_tests",
  "commandName": "getMore",
  "requestId": 45,
  "operationId": 39,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 19,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  }
}
{
  "duration": 0,
  "commandName": "getMore",
  "requestId": 45,
  "operationId": 39,
  "connectionId": {
    "id": 19,
    "host": "localhost",
    "port": 27017
  },
  "reply": [
    {
      "_id": "55c096386e3b2283b70c2951",
      "a": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** all the documents share the same `operationId`, allowing the
APM API user to correctly map the low level commands to the logical
command executed by the user (in this case `toArray` on a cursor).

### operationIdGenerator

The `operationIdGenerator` option allows the API user to pass in a
custom `operationId` generator object. You can use this object to
synchronize internal request IDs in the APM client with the low-level
command monitoring API. This synchronization makes it possible to
associate the logical method called by the user's code with the
low-level commands issued to MongoDB. This allows for a richer
APM experience and performance breakdown. Below is a simple
`operationIdGenerator` example.

```js
var generator = {
  operationId: 1,

  next: function() {
    return this.operationId++;
  }
};
```

### timestampGenerator

The `timestampGenerator` option lets the API user to override the method
used to timestamp the command monitoring events with a custom timestamp
type. The generator contains two methods. `current` returns the current 
timestamp` and `duration` calculates the total operation duration
between the `start` and `end` time. Below is a simple generator example.

```js
var generator = {
  current: function() {
    return new Date().getTime();
  },

  duration: function(start, end) {
    return end - start;
  }
}  
```

## Instrumentation

The `instrumentation` callback returns the instrumentation points in
the driver and associated metadata. In the following example, the
result shown is the result from performing `JSON.stringify`.

```js
{
  "name": "Gridstore",
  "stream": true,
  "instrumentations": [
    {
      "methods": [
        "open",
        "getc",
        "puts",
        "write",
        "writeFile",
        "close",
        "unlink",
        "readlines",
        "rewind",
        "read",
        "tell",
        "seek"
      ],
      "options": {
        "callback": true,
        "promise": true
      }
    },
    {
      "methods": [
        "eof"
      ],
      "options": {
        "callback": false,
        "promise": false,
        "returns": [
          null
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "methods": [
        "stream"
      ],
      "options": {
        "callback": false,
        "promise": false,
        "returns": [
          null
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "methods": [
        "destroy"
      ],
      "options": {
        "callback": false,
        "promise": false
      }
    },
    {
      "methods": [
        "chunkCollection",
        "collection"
      ],
      "options": {
        "callback": true,
        "promise": false,
        "returns": [
          null
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "methods": [
        "exist",
        "list",
        "read",
        "readlines",
        "unlink"
      ],
      "options": {
        "callback": true,
        "promise": true,
        "static": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

* `name` the name of the class exposed for instrumentation.
* `stream` tells the user if the object can operate as a Node.js stream.
* `instrumentations` an array which contains all the methods available
  for instrumentation. The methods are grouped
  by method characteristics. All methods that support a callback as well
  as a promise will be grouped in a single instrumentation. This
  simplifies the code to perform the actual instrumentation.

```js
{
  "methods": [
    "open",
    "getc",
    "puts",
    "write",
    "writeFile",
    "close",
    "unlink",
    "readlines",
    "rewind",
    "read",
    "tell",
    "seek"
  ],
  "options": {
    "callback": true,
    "promise": true
  }
}
```

The `methods` array contains all the methods that have the options
`callback=true` and `promise=true` for the GridStore prototype.
The available options are:

| Options          | Description                                                |
| ------------- |:-----------------------------------------------------------|
| callback       | The method supports a callback |
| promise       | The method can return a promise |
| static       | The method is a static method (not on the prototype) |
| returns       | The method can return one of the types in the array |

Below is a very basic instrumentation example.

```js
var listener = require('../..').instrument(function(err, instrumentations) {
  instrumentations.forEach(function(obj) {
    var object = obj.obj;

    // Iterate over all the methods that are just callback with no return
    obj.instrumentations.forEach(function(instr) {
      var options = instr.options;

      if(options.callback
        && !options.returns && !options.static) {

        // Method name
        instr.methods.forEach(function(method) {
          var applyMethod = function(_method) {
            var func = object.prototype[_method];

            overrides.push({
              obj: object.prototype, method: _method, func: func
            });

            object.prototype[_method] = function() {
              if(!methodsCalled[_method]) methodsCalled[_method] = 0;
              methodsCalled[_method] = methodsCalled[_method] + 1;
              var args = Array.prototype.slice.call(arguments, 0);
              func.apply(this, args);                
            }                
          }

          applyMethod(method);
        });
      }
    });
  });
});
```

This instrumentation only overrides methods that have callbacks and
ignores promises, so it's not a complete solution, but shows how an
API user can structure code to tap into the exposed surface of the
driver.
