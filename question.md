#### Question - 

MongoDB version 4 is released:
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/release-notes/4.0/

just curious why there's not a version 4.x for the 'mongodb' NPM library:

```
$ npm view mongodb version
```

yields:

```
3.3.2
```

I created this dumb PR because there is no issue tracker, seems annoying to not have that.
I am sure a lot of idiots like me file tickets, but closing dumb tickets does not take that much time does it?
