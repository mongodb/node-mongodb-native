<p>Given that you have created your own project using `npm init` we install the mongodb driver and its dependencies by executing the following `npm` command.</p>

<p><code>
npm install mongodb --save
</code></p>

<p>
This will download the MongoDB driver and add a dependency entry in your `package.json` file.
