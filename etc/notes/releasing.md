# Releasing MongoDB Node.js Packages

> [!NOTE]
> _Last updated: Thu Jun 6_

## Pre-requisites

- You must be an employee of MongoDB.
- You must have maintainer access to the repository you are publishing a release for.

## `release-please`

Every commit that lands on a release branch **MUST** follow [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) formatting.
The format of each commit message determines the next semantic version from that branch.
We use a CLI tool called [`release-please`](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) via a [github action](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please-action) of the same name.
`release-please` maintains our `HISTORY.md` and automatically writes the new version to our `package.json` (etc.) files.
Every new commit to a release branch caused the action to update the history and version files in a pending release PR.
Merging the release PR will make the action create a Github Release and subsequently because a "release_created" flag is true, we run npm publish from within the same action.

> See the release workflow here: [.github/workflows/release.yml](.github/workflows/release.yml)

## Release Notes

The contents of the release PR's body becomes the contents of the Github Release.
This is used to prepare descriptive and colorful release notes using [Github Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm/).
All of the PRs that are going into the next release should have **Release Highlight** sections describing the downstream impact of the fix or feat.
These sections **MUST** contain a level 3 markdown header.

```
<!-- RELEASE_HIGHLIGHT_START -->

### Enhanced compatibility with CoffeeScript

The MongoDB driver can now generate a cup of joe.

<!-- RELEASE_HIGHLIGHT_END -->`
```

> The supporting scripts for parsing and building markdown are here: [.github/scripts](.github/scripts)

## Release Instructions

1. On slack notify `#node-driver-docs`, `#nodejs-devtools`, and `#mongoose` that we intend to publish a release.
    - You may skip this step if you are releasing a package other than the driver.
1. Comment "`run release_notes`" on the release PR.
    - This will kick off the action that reads the notes from each PR going into the release.
    - Double check the result looks logically organized
    - You may edit the PR body for any quick edits or re-orderings.
    - If there are a number of changes, edit the original PRs and post a new `run` comment
1. Merge the release PR
    - If this is a release to a previous major, navigate to the new release and reset "latest" to our latest release in our _current_ major.
1. If this is a new driver minor release, generate the new documentation
    - **Check out the git tag** and run `npm run build:docs  -- --tag=<version>`
    - `<version>` should be formatted MAJOR.MINOR (ex. `--tag=6.8`)
    - Check the changes with: `npm run preview:docs`
    - Post a PR with the generated docs targeting `main`
        - You may need to stash/rebase depending on where the tag was, see [etc/docs/README.md](etc/docs/README.md)
1. Announce it!
    - Post an update about the newly released versions to `#nodejs` channel in Slack
    - If releasing the driver, post to the community forums about the new release
    - [Example 6.0.0 post](https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/mongodb-nodejs-driver-6-0-0-released/241691)
        - Copy what was in the release highlights section of your GitHub release post
        - Topic: node-js
        - Category: About the Community Product & Driver Announcements
1. Mark the [fix version as released in JIRA](https://jira.mongodb.org/projects/NODE?selectedItem=com.atlassian.jira.jira-projects-plugin%3Arelease-page&status=unreleased).

### Authentication

The github action is able to publish with the repository secret `NPM_TOKEN`.
This is a granular API key that is unique to each package and has to be rotated on a regular basis.
The `dbx-node@mongodb.com` npm account is the author of the automated release.

### Prebuilds

Our native packages offer pre built binaries using [`prebuild`](https://github.com/prebuild/prebuild).
prebuild uploads archives of the native dependency to the github release.
`prebuild-install` will handle downloading the correct binary when the package is installed by downstream projects.
Uploading binaries should happen automatically after the git tag/github release has been made.
It may take some time for the building and uploading to finish, but no more than a few hours at most.
