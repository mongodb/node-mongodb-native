      <description>Migrating Your Application To 2.x There are some key changes in the driver that you should be aware of before migrating your application from version 1.x to 2.x. Some APIs are cleaned up, and some 1.x features have been deprecated.
Design differences in 2.x One major change is that the driver has been split into two pieces. There is a new mongodb-core that contains the low-level MongoDB APIs while mongodb contains the high-level driver.</description>
